# DemoCRM

A simple CRM project to demonstrate coding and business logic concepts.

## Demonstration
I will be hosting a demo over at https://democrm.nbarr.dev. I will make every effort to ensure that it has
some kind of basic functionality; however it is a rolling development project (naturally).

You can use the username 'test@example.com' and password 'abcd1234' to log in.

# Changes

## revision 1 (r1)
This is the inaugural version 
 - Quickly set up a login and dashboard screen.
 - Scaffold some of the basic screens
 - Create "leads" code infrastructure (models, services, views, etc.)
